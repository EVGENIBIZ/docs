All successful transactions with Maestro, V PAY, Mastercard, Visa, Bancontact and iDEAL (status **SUCCESS**) are credited once per calendar day (00:00–24:00).

Billink is settled directly by Billink while transactions still appear in the Dashboard.

- Refunds and Retourpin (POS only) transactions are deducted from that day’s total.
- If the balance is negative, the amount is debited from your account.
- If the balance is exactly €0, no booking is made.
- You can choose a different closing time (for example, 02:00 if your shop is open late).

### **Payout reference structure**

Each booking on your account includes an identifier, allowing you to reconcile it easilyto easily reconcile it.

| **Level**                                                 | **Identifier** | **Length** | **Notes**                               |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- | :--------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| Contract                                                  | Contract_ID    | 8 digits   | Padded with leading zeros if shorter    |
| Shop                                                      | Shop_ID        | 8 digits   | Same rule as above                      |
| Commercial Unit                                           | Verkpnt_ID     | 8 digits   | Same rule as above                      |
| Webshop, Payment Request Plus or Cash Deposit (Afstorten) | Betaalpunt_ID  | 8 digits   | Same rule as above                      |
| POS Terminal                                              | Terminal ID    | 6 digits   | Shorter, so the line shifts 2 positions |

- After the date, the payout line displays a **cycle number** (usually “1”, but may be “2” or “3” if multiple payout cycles occur on the same day).
- PayPal settlements are handled directly by the provider, not Rabobank.

### **Example payout lines**

Here’s how the credit lines appear on your bank statement:

| **Scenario**                                       | **Line example**               |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| Contract level                                     | Contract_12345678 20160701_1   |
| Shop level                                         | Winkel_012345678 20160701_1    |
| Commercial unit                                    | Verkpnt_12345678 20160701_1    |
| POI (Terminal ID – 6 digits)                       | Betaalpunt_123456 20160701_1   |
| POI (Webshop, Payment Request, Deposit – 8 digits) | Betaalpunt_12345678 20160701_1 |

For deductions (**inhouding**), the format is the same, with Rabo Smart Pay inhouding instead of Omzet bijschrijving.

### **Merchant Reconciliation Reference (MRR)**

You can add your own **MRR** (8 alphanumeric characters, including underscore) to payout lines at shop, commercial unit, or payment point level.

- If shorter than 8, it is padded with leading zeros.
- The MRR appears as an extra line in the credit or deduction booking.
- Example: Mrr_wink:test1 20160701_1

### **Number of bookings per day**

| **Payout level**           | **Max number of bookings per day**                                      |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contract                   | 1                                                                       |
| Shop                       | Equal to number of businesses you have                                  |
| Commercial unit            | Equal to number of commercial units                                     |
| Point of Interaction (POI) | Equal to number of POIs (terminals, webshops, or Payment Request units) |

_Note: If the day’s balance (turnover minus refunds/Retourpinnen) is exactly €0, no booking is created._

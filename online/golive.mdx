<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate your production keys">
    - In the Smart Pay Dashboard, go to **Self service → Webshops → three dots → Details → Generate production keys**.
    - You’ll receive a **Refresh Token** and a **Signing Key**.
    - Copy these immediately – they can only be shown once. Later, you can only view the first and last four characters. If you lose them, you will need to generate new keys.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your webhook">
    - The [webhook](/technical/webhooks) is **mandatory** in production.
    - Enter your production webhook in the Dashboard: **Self service → Webshops → 3 dots → Details → Integration settings**.

    The webhook ensures you always receive the final [<u>payment status</u>](/technical/webhooks), even if the customer does not return to your webshop.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your integration">
    - Change the endpoint URL from the Sandbox to the production URL:\
      https://betalen.rabobank.nl/omnikassa-api

    Replace test credentials with your **production Refresh Token and Signing Key**.
  </Step>

After these steps, your OnlineKassa is live, and customers can pay through the secure Rabobank environment.

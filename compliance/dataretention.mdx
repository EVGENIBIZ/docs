### **Transaction data retention and compliance**

As a merchant, you are required to keep transaction data for audit and compliance purposes.

- **Retention period**: 14 months per transaction.
- **Response time**: You must be able to provide the requested transaction data to Rabobank (or its third-party auditors) within **16 days**.
- **Storage**: Data can be physical or digital, but it must be protected against misuse and comply with relevant data protection and privacy regulations.

**Destruction**: After the mandatory retention period, data must be destroyed in a way that makes it unreadable.

### Additional Requirements

- All transactions (successful or unsuccessful) that received an authorisation message must be recorded sequentially.
- You must keep this sequential record available for up to **2 years** and provide it to Rabobank in printed form upon request.
- Rabobank may request supporting documents such as proof of delivery. If you cannot provide this within 16 days, the transaction is treated as invalid, and Rabobank will reclaim the credited amount.

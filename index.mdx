## Overview

Rabo Smart Pay is Rabobank's all-in-one payment solution that brings all your payment channels together in one place. Whether you start with a single payment terminal or operate multiple shops and webshops, you can set it up to match your business and adjust it as your needs change.

The platform combines in-shop, online, and SoftPOS (Tap to Pay) payments in a single, secure environment. All online payment methods are available to your customers on both desktop and mobile devices, without any extra setup.  You manage everything from the Smart Pay Dashboard, which shows sales across all channels, compares payment types, and helps you identify trends. Transaction details appear almost immediately for online payments, while terminal payments are visible in the dashboard within few hours.

With integrated reporting and built-in security standards, Smart Pay reduces administration and safeguards transactions. That way, you spend less time on payment management and more on running your business.

## Where and how can you use Smart Pay?

Smart Pay works across different sales channels, so you can choose what fits your business. You can combine channels freely - all payments still appear in one dashboard.

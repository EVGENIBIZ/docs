title: "Brand guidelines and payment page customisation"
description: "When customers pay in your webshop, they should clearly recognise both your business and the payment method they choose. This creates trust and prevents confusion at checkout."

#### **Branding requirements**

- Always use the **official logos** of payment methods (iDEAL, Visa, Mastercard, Bancontact, PayPal, Apple Pay, Billink, etc.).
- Logos must appear in their **original colours and proportions**. Do not alter, stretch, or crop them.
- Show the logos in visible places on your webshop (for example, in the footer and during checkout).
- If you offer **iDEAL QR**, display the QR code exactly as defined in the iDEAL guidelines.

#### **Checkout page look & feel**

The OnlineKassa hosted checkout page is optimised for both desktop and mobile. You can customise its appearance using the **Checkout Editor** in the Smart Pay Dashboard:

- Add your webshop logo if it meets requirements:
  - It must be your official company or webshop logo.
  - It must not infringe on copyright, portrait rights, or trademarks.
  - It must not contain offensive or prohibited images or words.
  - It must not contain images of weapons.
  - It must have sufficient colour contrast so that it is readable for people with visual impairments.
- Choose from predefined colour themes.
- Arrange the order of payment methods.

This way, the payment page aligns with your webshop, while still operating in Rabobankâ€™s **secure, PCI DSS-certified environment**.

#### **How bookings and credits work**

- **Daily crediting** – Payments via iDEAL, Bancontact, and cards (Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, V PAY) are bundled and credited to your Rabobank business account once per calendar day.
- **Net settlement** – Refunds, chargebacks, and transaction fees are automatically deducted from the daily payout.
- **PayPal** – Transactions are credited directly to your PayPal business account. They do not flow via Rabobank.
- **Apple Pay** – Processed through the underlying card (Visa/Mastercard/Maestro/V PAY). Settlement follows standard card payout rules.

Transactions appear almost instantly in your Smart Pay Dashboard. Settlement to your account is reflected in your bank statement on the following business day.

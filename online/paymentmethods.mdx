<Info>
  - Apple Pay transactions are not a separate method; instead, they use the underlying card scheme fees.
  - iDEAL stepped pricing applies a stepped price to all iDEAL transactions across OnlineKassa, Payment Request Plus, and QR channels, ranging from €0.25 to €0.15 per transaction (from 2000\+ transactions).
  - PayPal and Billink have **external settlement accounts** – these payouts do not flow through Rabobank, but they still appear in the Dashboard.
  - The Billink fee for non-Dutch buyers may differ.

title: "Chargebacks and disputes"
description: "Description of your new file."

If a customer disputes the **amount paid** or the **quality of goods or services**, you are expected to handle the complaint fairly and promptly.\
If you agree with the customer, you should resolve the issue through:

- Refund (via the Smart Pay Dashboard for iDEAL, including QR, Billink, Bancontact, Mastercard, Maestro, Visa, and V PAY). For PayPal, refunds can be processed via the Dashboard/app or your PayPal environment.
- Exchange, coupon, or product repair.

Timely resolution helps prevent chargebacks.

### **Cards (Visa, Mastercard, Maestro, V PAY)**

- A cardholder can dispute a payment for reasons such as fraud, non-receipt of goods, or technical errors.
- Chargebacks are processed through the card schemes and handled by Worldline (Rabobank’s acquirer).
- The disputed amount is temporarily deducted from your account. You’ll see the case and status in your Smart Pay Dashboard.
- You can contest a chargeback (“representment”) by submitting evidence, such as:
  - Proof of delivery (tracking or signed receipt)
  - Refund confirmation
  - Customer communication
  - Accepted terms and conditions
- Deadlines are strict – typically **7–14 days** to respond.
- If your evidence is accepted, the chargeback is reversed. If not, the cardholder keeps the refund.
- Payments authenticated with **3D Secure (3DSv2)** usually shift liability for fraud away from you.
- Chargeback fees may apply per case.

### **iDEAL**

- Payments are normally **final and irrevocable**. Customers cannot raise standard chargebacks.
- Refunds are possible up to **180 days** after payment, via Dashboard or API.
- In rare cases (fraud or technical error), Rabobank may reverse a payment and reclaim the amount from your account.

### **PayPal**

- Disputes and chargebacks are handled entirely through PayPal.
- You manage these cases in your PayPal business account.

### **Billink (Buy Now, Pay Later)**

- Disputes are handled through Billink’s own process.
- You can initiate refunds from the Smart Pay Dashboard; however, chargebacks are subject to Billink’s rules.

  **Warning signs of possible fraud**

  If you notice one or more of the following signals, consider doing a **manual check** before shipping goods or providing services:

  - Orders using **anonymous or mismatched email addresses** (e.g. random letter/number combinations not linked to the cardholder name).
  - **Unusually high order amounts** compared to your average ticket size, especially for easily resold goods or services.
  - **Contradictions in purchase details** – for example, a request to deliver goods to a country where they are produced or are normally cheaper than in the Netherlands.
  - A single customer (with the same name, delivery address, IP address, or email) attempts to use multiple credit cards – often with several failed attempts before one is successful.
</Warning>

  **Tips to reduce disputes and chargebacks**

  Clear communication and fast service help avoid disputes. We recommend:

  - Clearly display your **contact information** on your website.
  - Allow customers to **track their order status**.
  - Respond quickly when customers raise issues.
  - Process **refunds or credit notes promptly** (Smart Pay Dashboard makes this simple).
  - Publish and require acceptance of your **terms and conditions** (warranty, cancellation, refunds, etc.).
  - Be transparent about your **cancellation and refund procedures** during checkout.
  - Respond quickly if Rabobank requests additional documentation about a transaction.
